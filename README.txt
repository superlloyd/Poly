This projet demonstrate a Polynomial utility class

It supports the following operations:
	- + - * /
	Derivate Integrate
	FindRoots (Polynomial root solver, i.e. value for which the Polynomial compute to 0)
	Compute, of course! for double and Complex
	Bezier Equations

It was mostly used (so far) to calculate distance to Bezier Segments, with the PolygonUtils class, which has the following methods:
	Distance To Bezier
	Distance To Segment

It comes with unit test a a test WPF applications.
