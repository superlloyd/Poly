This class is an excerpt from my personal project.

This class is a little show case for a Polynomial class I worked on

Supported operation:
- Polynomial class with the following operation
	- + - * /
	Derivate Integrate
	FindRoots (Polynomial root solver, i.e. value for which the Polynomial compute to 0)
	Compute, of course! for double and Complex
	Bezier Equations


Finally in PolygonUtils there are the (now very simple) measurement methods, demonstrate by
calculate shortest distance to Bezier Segment with WPF demo.
