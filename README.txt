This projet demonstrate a Polynomial utility class

Supported operation:
	- + - * /
	Derivate Integrate
	FindRoots (Polynomial root solver, i.e. value for which the Polynomial compute to 0)
	Compute, of course! for double and Complex
	Bezier Equations


Finally in PolygonUtils there are the some measurement methods
(illustrated in the WPF demo)
	Distance To Bezier
	Distance To Segment

Which I used as the basis of my visual test.
