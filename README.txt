This class is an excerpt from my personal project.

It contains all the code needed to Point to BezierSegment distance measurement.
It turned out to be quite a lot of Math!

One need:
- Complex arithmetic (check, Complex.cs)
- Polynomial class with the following operation
	- + - * /
	Derivate()
	FindRoots() (i.e. value for which the Polynomial compute to 0)
	Compute(x), of course! for double and Complex
	BezierEquations

Find in PolygonUtils there are the (now very simple) measurement methods
